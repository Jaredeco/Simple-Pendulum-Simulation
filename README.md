# Simple-Pendulum - Simulation
A Simple-Pendulum simulation made with Python-Pygame. Pendulum's motion is simulated using harmonic motion principles. 
## Features
- Values of the Pendulum can be adjusted (Amplitude, Length, Gravitational Acceleration)
- Real-Time Graph of the Pendulum's Displacement, Acceleration, Velocity over Time
