# Simple Pendulum - Simulation
A simple pendulum simulation made with Python-Pygame. Pendulum is simulated using harmonic motion principles. 
## Features
- Values of the Pendulum can be adjusted (Amplitude, Length, Gravitational Acceleration)
- Real-Time Graph of the Pendulum's Displacement, Acceleration, Velocity over Time
